	<h1>Vlad's Hobbies</h1>

	<p> I spend most of my time driving my cab and drinking. But not at the same time of course, my friend! <p>
	<p> Here is what I do when I get some time off work. <br><br></p>
	<img src="hockey.jpg" alt="Hockey" hspace="5" style="float:left;width:400px;margin-right:20px;">
	<p> Hockey has been a sport of choice since I was a child. I play in the cup <br>league for my area and currently help as an assistant coach for the local<br> youth league. <br><br><br><br>
	</p>
	<p> In my spare time I work with my friend, Anton, on my LADA 4x4 in his <br>mechanic shop on Popov Street. With Anton's help I am learning to build and <br>maintain street cars and offroad vehicles with my savings as a taxi driver.
