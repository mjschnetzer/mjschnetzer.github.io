	My Hometown - Rybinsk, Russia 
	<p> As a boy I spent most of my time working and playing at my parent's <br>farm. It was outside of Rybinsk, a 
	small city located at the mouth of <br>the Volga river with beautiful architecture. As I started going to school<br> I
	spent more time in the city, finding odd jobs and causing trouble. I <br>still travel to the area to go to
	the theater with my mother or drink <br>with old friends.

	<p style="color:white"> Current Residence - Moscow, Russia </p>
	<p style="color:white"> I learned I enjoyed life in the city. After completing secondary school <br>in Rybinsk I decided to move to a 
		cheap apartment in the Barrikadnaya <br>Area. I worked as a ganitor for an industrial complex before finding an
		<br>opening as a cab driver. I worked my way up to move into a flat in <br>Tverskaya. My building is near many bars I frequent and
		my favorite <br> resturaunt, Khachapuri. After work I relax and view at the city from my <br>11th floor balcony.
